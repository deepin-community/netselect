netselect (0.3.ds1-26) unstable; urgency=medium

  * netselect-apt: Apply patch provided by Ben Wong in order to 
    fix some bugs
     - Add 'jessie' to netselect to make it possible to search mirrors
       of that codename (Closes: #713838)
     - Ignore corrupted results (negative score) and throw them out. 
       Netselect does not handle gracefully mirrors which use 
       a Round Robin DNS (see bug #755238).
       The fix prevents netselect-apt from selecting mirrors with a '-'
       in some cases (Closes: #750952)
     - Return with an error in test_host if curl is not available or
       if an empty host is provided (as suggested by doekia in #750952)

netselect (0.3.ds1-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * netselect-apt:
     - Add a -d (debug) option as well as logging if debug is enabled
     - Extend the host validation routine by making netselect-apt download
       the 'README' file in the remote server and have it check if the
       contents there are what one would expect of a Debian mirror.

netselect (0.3.ds1-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * netselect-apt:
    - Fix the parsing of the -t option
    - Ensure that the netselect options are defined *after* the command line
      parsing to make it possible to modify them through the command line.
    - Add a -c option to make it possible to filter by country (Closes: #273688)
  * netselect-apt.1:
    - Document the new '-c' option
    - List known limitations of the program
    - Reference the mirror pages for Debian for more information
    - Add the Debian maintainers to the author's list

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Sep 2011 20:50:02 +0200

netselect (0.3.ds1-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * netselect-apt:
    - Do not settle for only one server as indicated by netselect but, instead,
      retrieve the top-10 hosts (configurable through a '-t' option) and select
      the fastest hosts which can be accessed through the defined protocol.
      Tests are done using curl, and ensure that the hosts HTTP or FTP requests.
      This makes use of the '-s' option in netselect in a way similar to
      what was requested in #117265. The fastests servers are listed 
      in addition to the server chosen after verifying they are reachable
      (Closes: #117265)
  * netselect-apt.1: 
    - Document behaviour and the new option (-t) in the manpage.
  * debian/control:
    - Add 'curl' as Recommended for netselect-apt

netselect (0.3.ds1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Downgrade dpkg-dev from Recommends to Suggests since
    it (and its related dependencies) will pull in way too many
    packages (over 20MB worth) (Closes: 629833)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Jun 2011 01:07:21 +0200

netselect (0.3.ds1-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * netselect.c: 
      - Add a new -D option to force netselect to provide, if required,
        the DNS names for hosts that resolve to multiple IP addresses.
        Modify the code so that the dnsname is kept on the host struct
        and printed, if this option is used, when netselect finishes.
        (Closes: #136849)
      - Notify through stderr if the number of hosts found are (at least)
        the number of hosts and also return with error 1 if no hosts
        are found. This helps clarify the situation when all the probed
        hosts are considered invalid and no one is returned (Closes: 467303)
  * netselect-apt: 
      - Make the script more robust by having it check and detect some common
        issues when running netselect:
        *  No hosts are found to use with netselect, due to an incorrect file
        being provided or an error when downloading the mirror list, or,
        *  Netselect does not return any host to netselect-apt
        Now the script will at least abort with a (hopefully useful)
        error message instead of writing a useless sources.list
        (Closes: 238888)
      - Use the -D option (see above) by default so that the information
        introduced is always a name and not an IP address as many Debian
        servers use DNS round robin and the servers cannot be accessed
        using an IP address (Closes: 420252)
      - Use dpkg-architecture if available, otherwise fall back to 
        "dpkg --print-architecture" instead (Closes: 609342)
      - Add 'wheezy' as a valid distribution (Closes: 623180)
   * netselect.1:
      - Fix typos in manpage (Closes: #605654)
      - Document the new '-D' option and also add new examples how both
        the tag feature and the -D option can be used, trying to reflect
        the disadvantages of it  (using as a reference the discussion
        in bug log #136849)
      - Remove whitespace from output in examples to help readability.
    * debian/control:
      - netselect-apt: Add a Recommends on dpkg-dev since we use
        dpkg-architecture
    * Translations:
      - Added Danish translation provided by Joe Hansen (Closes: #623101)

netselect (0.3.ds1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take over this package's maintenance, with maintainer's approval.
  * netselect:
      - Implement a -I option to make netselect use ICMP probes instead of UDP.
        This option is useful to test servers when there is some element
        that does not allow traceroute tests in the intermediate path 
        (including the local computer, through it's firewall).  
        (Closes: 601227, 217256, 384218)
      - Do not printout verbose messages detailing hosts to stdout but
        to stderr
  * netselect.1:
     - Document the new -I option
     - Add more examples, specifically describing the issues with multiple
       DNS names in hosts.
  * netselect-apt:
     - Introduce a way to provide options to netselect through -O
     - Check if netselect exists 
     - Abort if not being run as root and netselect is not setuid
     - Use -I per default as many debian mirrors do not actually allow
       traceroute tests
     - Only use standard output when parsing netselect's output, stderr
       gets thrown out as we do not need it (but the user might have
       set it with -v calls in -O)
     - Stricter filtering of netselect output to prevent picking up
       wrong data by mistake 
  * debian/netselect.README.Debian: More information on why netselect
    needs to be run as ROOT.
  * debian/control: 
      - Update Homepage to github
      - Update SVN-Browse to github, keep the URL of collab-main
        in debian/README.source
  * debian/EXTRA: include modified version of netselect-apt by
    Manuel Estrada Sainz a long time ago (2002) which provides additional
    features such as testing for other protocols (rsync, ftp, http)
    and checking that the mirrors actually work. This code needs to
    be forward ported to netselect-apt in order to close 135558. But having
    it in the package at least ensures it is not forgotten.
  * debian/TODO: review all pending work to be done and include it in the
    file, reference bug reports when appropriate.
  * debian/netselect-apt.NEWS and debian/netselect.NEWS: Fix version
    numbers as they pointed to inexistent versions
