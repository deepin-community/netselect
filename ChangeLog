	Oops.  Typo in netselect-apt.

  (apenwarr) Wed Aug 29 05:54:40 EDT 2001
	Final changes for Debian package.

  (apenwarr) Wed Aug 29 05:36:44 EDT 2001
	Wrote netselect-apt, and preparing to release the new Debian package
	for 0.3.

  (apenwarr) Wed Aug 29 04:33:23 EDT 2001
	Fixed some bugs, increased fairness between hosts (we remember our
	place in the queue after sending a packet, rather than always starting
	over at the first host), and added code to dynamically adjust the
	outgoing packet rate depending on observed latency.  This about halves
	the time netselect takes to run through debian-ftp-mirrors!

  (apenwarr) Wed Aug 29 03:26:27 EDT 2001
	Netselect now accepts arguments in URL or ftp format
	(http://hostname.org:port/dir/file or hostname.org:dir/file) and
	prints scores in the original URL format.  This makes it possible to
	choose the "fastest url" from a list.  Now, wouldn't it ben neat if
	netselect also verified that the http/ftp/whatever server was actually
	running on that server...

  (apenwarr) Wed Aug 29 02:45:46 EDT 2001
	We now properly handle hostnames that resolve to multiple addresses.
	For such hostnames, the results/score output uses each resolved IP
	address, rather than the hostname itself.  The hostname isn't really
	useful as netselect output, since each corresponding IP address can
	have a totally different score.

  (apenwarr) Tue Aug 28 21:47:47 EDT 2001
	OS/2 support by Kyosuke TOKORO <tokoro@mx5.harmonix.ne.jp> (or maybe
	NBG01720@nifty.ne.jp).

  (apenwarr) Thu May 18 00:05:16 EDT 2000
	Changes to Debian packaging for 0.2-5.

  (apenwarr) Tue Feb 01 00:34:18 EST 2000
	Fixed infinitely decrementing validhosts (when any host fails to
	lookup) thanks to Andreas Krüger <andreas.krueger@online.life.de>.
	Also disabled receive coagulation for now, after thinking about it on
	his prompting.  We're still not ideal though.

  (apenwarr) Fri Jan 28 05:17:56 EST 2000
	Debian changelog changes from last time.


Release 0.2 (1998 09 10)
-----------

  (apenwarr) Thu Sep 10 14:17:53 EDT 1998
	Minor debian fixes.

  (apenwarr) Tue Sep 08 03:05:21 EDT 1998
	Added debianization stuff.

  (apenwarr) Tue Sep 08 02:48:47 EDT 1998
	Directory /netselect/debian added to the repository

  (apenwarr) Tue Sep 08 02:45:55 EDT 1998
	Updated README.  Fixed a few display buglets.

  (apenwarr) Tue Sep 08 02:31:11 EDT 1998
	Added '-s' option, to "select" the best few servers automatically.

  (apenwarr) Tue Sep 08 02:01:47 EDT 1998
	Added parallel DNS resolving (MUCH faster).  Dramatically increased
	"fairness" in testing -- lag time and %thruput calculations are much
	closer to reality.

  (apenwarr) Mon Sep 07 22:37:58 EDT 1998
	Added the ChangeLog file.
